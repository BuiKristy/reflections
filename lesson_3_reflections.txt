When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  You'd want to use a remote repository when you're uploading your code online for other people to work on.
  It's much easier for people to collaborate when you have all the work in one place and you can push or fetch files onto 
  your computer to and from GitHub. When you're working locally, you can then upload your work to GitHub and still merge files
  and such. But then other teammates will also be able to remotely access your work and upload their work as well.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Pulling changes manually is better because you get to figure out where changes are being pulled to and Git doesn't have to 
  guess what branch you're wanting to pull changes to and such. But pulling files can be a problem in general because you don't 
  get a chance to see what changes are being made and your working directory gets updated without seeing what kinds of things 
  were changed.
