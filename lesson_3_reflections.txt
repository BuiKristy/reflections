When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  You'd want to use a remote repository when you're uploading your code online for other people to work on.
  It's much easier for people to collaborate when you have all the work in one place and you can push or fetch files onto 
  your computer to and from GitHub. When you're working locally, you can then upload your work to GitHub and still merge files
  and such. But then other teammates will also be able to remotely access your work and upload their work as well.
