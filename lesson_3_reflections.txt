When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  You'd want to use a remote repository when you're uploading your code online for other people to work on.
  It's much easier for people to collaborate when you have all the work in one place and you can push or fetch files onto 
  your computer to and from GitHub. When you're working locally, you can then upload your work to GitHub and still merge files
  and such. But then other teammates will also be able to remotely access your work and upload their work as well.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Pulling changes manually is better because you get to figure out where changes are being pulled to and Git doesn't have to 
  guess what branch you're wanting to pull changes to and such. There may also be a lot of changes you don't get a chance to see, and
  pulling files can be a problem in general because you don't get a chance to see what changes are being made and your working
  directory gets updated without seeing what kinds of things were changed.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Forks are used for when you want to clone something on a GitHub repository. It's much easier to do so than to clone a repository from 
  GitHub to your computer and then pushing it to your own account because it doesn't give recognition to the GitHub user either. Clones 
  are used for when you want to copy a repository into a new directory. Branches are similar to forks in your own repository and are for 
  when you are working on something new that separate from your main working code and can be experimental to work on multiple features
  at once.
